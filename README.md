# Project Management Tool

A web-based project management tool built with React that allows users to create and manage members, projects, and tasks. Users can assign tasks to team members and update task statuses using a drag-and-drop interface.

## Features

- **Create and Manage Projects:** Add new projects and assign tasks to specific team members.
- **Create and Manage Tasks:** Easily create tasks, assign them to team members, and track their progress.
- **Task Status Update via Drag-and-Drop:** Use a drag-and-drop interface (powered by `react-beautiful-dnd`) to update the status of tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).
- **Member Management:** Add and manage members to assign tasks and responsibilities.
- **Routing for Seamless Navigation:** Use `react-router-dom` to navigate between different parts of the application, such as project overview and detailed task views.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application layout and elements.
- **react-beautiful-dnd**: A drag-and-drop library to enable task status updates.
- **react-router-dom**: Declarative routing for managing page navigation.
